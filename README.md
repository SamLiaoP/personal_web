👋 Hi, I’m Sam Liao — an AI Engineer passionate about building impactful AI systems and intelligent solutions.

💡 What I Do
- Develop Large Language Model (LLM) applications with a focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Fine-Tuning, and Agent Systems.
- Design AI-driven tools that extract insights from unstructured data and solve complex real-world business problems.
- Build scalable microservice architectures and optimize data pipelines for robust, efficient deployments on cloud platforms like GCP.

🛠 My Core Skills
- LLM Development: RAG, Graph RAG, Vector Databases (ChromaDB), Fine-Tuning (UnSloth, Hugging Face Transformers), Agent Frameworks (SMOLAgents, LangGraph, Agno)
- Software Engineering: Python, FastAPI, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD
- Cloud Engineering: GCP (GKE, Cloud Run, Vertex AI, Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage)
